# ModularInverses

This repository contains the code to accompany the paper "Modular Groups Where All Units Are Their Own Inverses". The program computes all integers $m \geq 2$ such that every unit modulo $m$ is its own inverse; i.e., such that $a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$ for every $a$ which is coprime to $m$.
